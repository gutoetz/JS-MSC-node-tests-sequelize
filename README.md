# Social Media Backend

This project is a Social Media Backend application that utilizes Sequelize, JavaScript, seeders, MSC (Model, Controllers, and Services) architecture, Express, Node.js, and Docker. The application provides functionalities for managing posts, user authentication, and post categorization.

## Overview

The Social Media Backend application serves as the server-side component for a social media platform. It implements a backend API that handles post management, user authentication, and post categorization. The project adopts the MSC (Model, Controllers, and Services) architecture pattern to organize and structure the codebase efficiently. Docker is used for containerization, enabling easy deployment and scalability.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and frameworks were utilized in the development of this project:

- Sequelize: Sequelize is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Node.js that simplifies database interactions and provides a higher-level abstraction for working with relational databases.
- JavaScript: JavaScript is the programming language used to develop the backend logic of the application.
- Seeders: Seeders are used to populate the database with initial data, allowing for easy setup and testing of the application.
- MSC Architecture: The MSC (Model, Controllers, and Services) architecture pattern separates the application logic into distinct layers, enhancing code organization and maintainability.
- Express: Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building APIs.
- Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows the execution of JavaScript code on the server-side.
- Docker: Docker is used for containerization, enabling the creation of isolated environments and simplified deployment.

## Functionality

The Social Media Backend application offers the following features and functionality:

- Post Management: It provides APIs for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting posts.
- User Authentication: The application includes user authentication mechanisms, such as login and registration endpoints, to secure access to the platform.
- Post Categorization: It allows posts to be categorized into different categories or tags, enabling efficient content organization.
